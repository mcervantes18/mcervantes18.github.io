                 <h3>YouTube Video</h3>
                <p>In this video I play with my cousin on GTA V and we are playing custom races and only leave the funny and epic moments into the video. so in this Video at the begining it starts off as just funny edits and moments and towards the end i edit it to be like a dramatic movie scene. This is personaly one of my favorite videos that i have done so far just because of the ending.</p>

                 <h3>Youtube Video</h3>
                <p>This was my very first "Funny Moments" video and feel like its one of the best, in this one i play Cod:Blackops and i play with another person and basicly just edit the video as best i could and for being my first video i feel like it did well. so basicly the entire video its just me being goofy, although for it being my first video you cant hear that im still pretty shy of knowing that im recording.</p>
